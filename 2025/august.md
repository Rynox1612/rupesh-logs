#### Apology to Myself  

**Date:** 22nd August 2025  

---

Dear Rupesh,  

I owe you an apology. For more than 25 days, I became inconsistent due to a prolonged fever.  
Even after recovering physically, it took me around 10 additional days just to regain my pace,  
my focus, and my rhythm with learning and practice.  

I know that this gap has delayed my progress, but I want to remind myself that it is okay to fall,  
as long as I stand up stronger. From this point forward, I promise to maintain consistency,  
value my health, and not let temporary setbacks shake my long-term goals.  

This apology is not a sign of weakness but a reminder of accountability —  
to stay honest with myself, to accept my mistakes, and to move ahead with more determination.  

---

**Sincerely,**  
Rupesh Sahu
